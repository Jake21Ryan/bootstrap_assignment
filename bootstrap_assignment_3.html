                <p>
               I’m a Computer Science student at Assumption University with a strong interest in software development, data analytics, and practical problem-solving. I enjoy building projects that combine creativity and technology from web applications to interactive dashboards.

I’m continuously improving my skills through hands-on university projects, teamwork, and real-world challenges. Outside academics, I enjoy learning new tools, traveling, and capturing moments through short videos. I’m motivated, curious, and always open to opportunities that help me grow both professionally and personally.
